# Galaxia_wrap

A few python scripts and tutorial notebooks to create and manipulate Galaxia mock catalogues.


**What is Galaxia**

Galaxia is a software to create mock stellar catalogues [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...730....3S]. You can plug in n-body simulations (which we will do in another notebook) or use a Galaxy model. Galaxia uses the old 2003 Besancon Model [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003A%26A...409..523R] and populates stars accordingly using Padova Isochrones [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008A%26A...482..883M]. You can add extinctions that are coming from a 3D extension of the Schlegel map [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...500..525S].

**Prerequisits**

Download Galaxia [https://sourceforge.net/projects/galaxia/files/] (for GeDR3mock an updated Galaxia version can be downloaded from [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/718161356a6e461ca412/]) and follow the instructions [http://galaxia.sourceforge.net/Galaxia3pub.html]. You will also have to install ebf into your python distribution via

```
pip install ebfpy
```

Before creating your first mock catalogue you will need to run

```
galaxia -s warp
```
which will run for some time.

***Legacy: GDR2mock***

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Start with the notebook**

Now you can dive into the notebook which will show you (a) how to create a magnitude limited catalogue and (b) how to input your n-body data to create mock observations. As an application for (b) we create a CMD from many SSP's using a flat SFR and look at the age distribution of RGB stars. This can be extended to any stellar tracer population and is useful top produce mock data, e.g. from Chempy abundance tracks [https://github.com/jan-rybizki/Chempy/blob/master/tutorials/5-Chempy_function_and_stellar_tracer_sampling.ipynb]. This age sampling has been explained here [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AN....337..880J]

This repository was setup for the Gaia Sprint 2017 [http://gaia.lol/].

In the meanwhile we have produced a mock GDR2 catalogue based on Galaxia: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASP..130g4101R]

***GeDR3mock***

New [notebooks](https://github.com/jan-rybizki/Galaxia_wrap/tree/master/notebook) were added in order to be able to reproduce or adapt GeDR3mock results.

It was all tested on a linux system with python 3. If you experience problems feel free to contact me.


**Resources - getting everything running**

The following files might prove useful if you want to reproduce what we have done in order to produce GeDR3mock [http://dc.g-vo.org/browse/gedr3mock/q].

Galaxia version that can be used in interplay with the new repository can be found here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/718161356a6e461ca412/]. I have hard-coded the line for the Besancon model file in 'galaxia.cpp' (line 410 and 411). You will have to change that by hand to the place where you put the Galaxia data and then recompile (go in the main galaxia directory and type 'make' in the console, then the executable galaxia file will be updated). Please also make sure to use the GeDR3mock version of the model file ('population_parameters_BGM_update.ebf' in the source_folder from above contains wrong parameters) which you can find here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/f/7543a05d7bb446efab4f/].

Mock cluster parameters can be inspected here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/822727acc95c4999bec0/].

Raw isochrones data can be found here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/89df3ade0aed48c2b4ac/].

Reduced isochrones can be found here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/cde7cad3a3994cc8998b/].

Isochrone arrays and extinction arrays that can be used for parsec indexing and extinction curve application can be found here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/44cee7ccbe5d4706b526/]. 

Extinction data cube can be found here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/a1e5bfdfacc94940ace1/].

Visibility query for contras sensitivity and reduction routine can be found here [https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de/d/02a3333d01a34e99a8f5/].

**GeDR3mock presentation**

Here is a [presentation](https://github.com/jan-rybizki/Galaxia_wrap/blob/master/GC_rybizki.pdf) of the GeDR3mock that I have given at MPIA. I am happy to give that talk again upon request and answer all your questions to the software/catalog.
