## Galaxia wrap tutorial roadmap

You can load the notebooks using ``jupyter notebook`` and then change the content interactively, once you downloaded this repository.
You can also just have a look at them here on github.

In **tutorial 1** we will use Galaxia to produce a magnitude limited survey of the Milky Way Galaxy.

**Tutorial 2** is about the n-body input to Galaxia. We will not use real n-body simulations but just create a CMD by producing SSPs with a constant SFR. The output can then be used to check e.g. the age distribution of specific stellar tracer population.
